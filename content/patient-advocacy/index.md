### Donate Life Arizona
I am a proud advocate for organ donation and transplantation, sharing my story to raise awareness and encourage others to register as organ donors.

In September 2021, I was featured by [Donate Life Arizona](https://www.donatelifeaz.org/) in a statewide campaign on the impact of organ, eye, and tissue donation. As a liver transplant recipient, I shared my story to encourage students and young adults to register as organ donors and to raise awareness about the importance of transplantation in saving lives.

This initiative was part of the Campus Challenge in partnership with Arizona colleges and universities.

### COTA for Adam K Campaign
Since 2020, I’ve partnered with the [Children’s Organ Transplant Association (COTA)](https://cota.org/cotaforadamk/), a nonprofit that supports transplant patients and their families through community-driven fundraising campaigns. With the help of friends and family, we launched **COTA for Adam K**, a campaign that continues to support my long-term medical needs following transplantation.

### Highlights

- **COTA for Adam K**  
  Active since 2020, this campaign has helped raise ongoing support for post-transplant care while also promoting awareness about organ donation and equitable access to treatment.

- **2022 COTA Calendar Feature**  
  I was featured in COTA’s national calendar, where I shared my personal transplant story as part of their effort to raise community awareness and engagement.

- **The Mulligan Golf Tournament** *(May 2022)*  
  I helped organize a local golf fundraiser that brought together community supporters and raised funds in support of COTA’s mission.
