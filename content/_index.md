title: "Adam M. Kurth"
subtitle: "PhD Student · Biostatistics @ Brown"
description: "I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Brown University School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics.
  My research interests include Bayesian modeling, nonparametrics, causal inference, machine learning, and applications in public health and epidemiology.
  I aim to investigate complex patient outcomes in clinical domains such as transplantation and cancer, using flexible Bayesian and causal models to address treatment effect heterogeneity, confounding, and to quantify individualized risk.
  Ultimately, I hope to develop methods that support personalized clinical decision-making and promote health equity."
